# Terraform Repository Structure

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive framework for Terraform configurations. It is designed to be scalable, reusable, and most importantly, Git-friendly. The framework is split into various directories, each serving a specific purpose.

---

## Directory Structure

- **global/**: Holds global configurations such as variables and outputs shared across environments.
- **modules/**: Encapsulates reusable modules.
- **backend-config/**: Contains backend configuration details for Terraform state management.
- **environments/**: Hosts configurations for different environments (e.g., staging, production).
- **scripts/**: Includes utility scripts for deployment and other tasks.

---

## Advantages

### Scalability
- Easily add more environments, modules, and configurations as your project scales.

### Reusability
- The modular approach allows you to reuse code across different environments and projects.

### Modularity
- Make changes to individual components without affecting the entire ecosystem.

### Organization
- Each section of your infrastructure is neatly organized in its own directory.

### Git-friendliness
- Version control is simplified, making it easier to track changes, roll back, and collaborate.

## Usage Guide

### Initial Setup

Create a new Terraform configuration file at the root directory with the following code to initialize the required providers:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}
